<title>Looking back on Core Foundations</title>
<div class="main-content">
            
    
    <h1>Why humanities??</h1>
   <p class="paragraphs"> 
    Core learnings were my favorite part of Foundations, hands down. It reinforced so much more about myself in terms 
    of <a class="giflink" href="identity-values.html" target="_blank">cultural identity and how my values were shaped.</a><br>
    It's made me want to be true to myself and be the best version of myself, and (i think) that's what employers are looking 
    for, right? Good humans? The ability to be self-aware enough to recognize what others are feeling? Or to just have basic 
    human empathy? Dev Academy has certainly surprised me with this one; a pleasant surprise in saying that though. <br>
    Who would've
    thought I would (re)learn all this stuff about being chillâ„¢ while doing a coding bootcamp? Definitely not me.<br>
    The most difficult thing about relearning how to be chill is to realize how un-chill I am now, all my mental health 
    practices I used to swear by are now items on my wishlist; meditation, mindfulness, physical exercise, good self-talk.
    All things I am slowly starting to do again but whether or not it stays a habit depends on me, and if I am to get through 
    bootcamp I guess I'm gonna have to aren't I.<br>
    I'm the only one to benefit, and whoever employs me too! From what Joseph has told us the tech industry is just like any 
    industry, they hire for fit, and train for skill(to a certain extent anyways). What good is being a god at working with a 
    computer if you can't work and collaborate with your fellow human?  <br>
    If I was to do this course all over again due to an episode of transient global amnesia I'd ask the same question I asked 
    myself. <i>This shit's cool is there more core stuff?<sup>(and less javascript please thanks)</sup></i>
