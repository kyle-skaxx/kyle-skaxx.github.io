            <h3>The ramblings of a Filipino in Aotearoa</h3>
            <p>
                It is widely claimed that our personal values are shaped by our <a class="giflink" target="_blank" href="https://forumea.org/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/What-are-Social-Identities.pdf">social identities </a>; <br>in this page I am going to give a good crack at telling you all about mine <br>
                I'd like to preface this whole section with a question I asked myself as I was preparing to write it. <br> 
                <em>'Are our personal values and consequent ethical decisions what we claim them to be or are they fluid to the social identity that we assume within the moment'</em> <br><br>
                I immediately thought back to the time where I was working as a knife hand at a butchery circa 2021. It was smoko™
                and I was lining up to get some food from the butchery's storefront.
                A person who had been known to shoplift was trying to get in but got recognized and stopped by one of the workers; the worker asks them to leave, they insisted they were only there for the hot food.
                Tensions escalated and whether it was my impatience to get my daily sustenance of a pie and some nicotine, or my social identity as a worker in the establishment; I entered the conversation begrudgingly <br>
                I first try to dissuade the person by appealing to them, the cops were already called at this point and I advised them to leave before the cops got truly involved, to no avail.
                They took it the wrong way and tried walking past me, I push them back which led to a very intense standoff and it ended with them walking away.
                In the midst of all the red I was seeing, a dark realization dawned on me, I was ready to fight someone who was just hungry. <br><br>
                I immediately regret my behavior but I put on a rather arrogant front for all my co-workers who seemed quite impressed with what just happened. 
                I came home that day confused, am I a true Westerner™ now? Have I forsaken the values that my mother had taught me? To always try feed the hungry? 
                Have I adopted the debilitating mindset of food being yet another commodity rather than a basic human necessity? Or was I just cranky and wanting a hit of nicotine?
                The following weeks I would randomly ask myself these questions and eventually, I knew I just had to forget about the whole situation and if ever a similar situation arose,
                I promised myself to be truer to the values I hold dear; one of them being food is meant to be shared.
                <br> <br>
                There was a disparity between who I was in that altercation to the person who I perceive myself to be.
                A concept I was raised on came to mind frequently in those weeks of self-doubt; <a class="giflink" target="_blank" href="https://themixedculture.com/2013/09/25/filipinos-bayanihan/"><em>Bayanihan.</em></a>
                A concept always portrayed as an innate spirit that we should always have. To help anyone in need within your social group or <em>bayan</em>.
                A concept that I saw in my Ma any time she went out of her way to feed the hungry. 
                A concept among many others which I considered were the building blocks to who I was; <br>
                A concept that I shall carry with me and pass on as others did with me.
