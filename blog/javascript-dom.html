<title>Into the DOM</title>
<div class="main-content">
            
    
    <h1>What is Javascript?</h1>
   <h2>and why do we use it.</h2>
    <p>Dubbed as the 'language of the web', it is what allows interactivity between user and product(website or app). <br> Examples are but not limited to: showing a side bar at the click of a button, playing audio and video in a web page, or displaying animations that look really cool!
    <br>
    What you can see below is the html code for my navigation bar in <a class="giflink" href="technical-directory.html" target="_blank">this page.</a>
    </p>
    <img src="img/javascript-ss.png">
    <p>
        <u>Underlined</u> are the javascript functions where if a user interacts with the button by clicking it, triggers the function.<br>
        But what is the function? What does it do if I click it? That is what is decided in Javascript as can be seen in the code below
    </p>
    
    <img src="img/javascript2-ss.png">
    <P>
        This function, although coded with the intention to bring out the side bar by pushing the main content to the right <br>(idk what happened but at a certain point i chose not to die on that hill), pulls out the side nav bar from the shadow realm and presents it to you <br> at the click of the "more" button
    </P>
    <br>
    <p>
        Having seen this example, I ask you to indulge me with this analogy; HTML and CSS is what makes a robot look like a robot,<br> javascript is a processing chip decides what the robot does when given stimuli.
    <br> 
    This robot is very methodical, it goes step by step unless instructed otherwise; this is what is known as <i>Control flow</i>
    <br>
    You can even tell the robot to go over different steps or information, set how many times it goes through that information, <br>and even make it go through the information in perpetuity, this is called a loop.
    </p>
    <h2>The DOM</h2>
    <p>With a name so ominous, I was mildly irked that all it meant was Document Object Model.
        <br>
        Building on the analogy, the DOM is like the blueprint for the whole robot, from its retractable claws to its laser vision. 
        <br>
        Knowing this, you can now change the robot's appearance just by telling the processing chip what you want.
    </p>
    <h2>Objects and Arrays</h2>
    <p>
        Now say the robots arm was an object, all the information pertaining to the robotic arm such as <br> retracted length, full length, density etc. are stored within the processing chip.
        <br>
        To access the information and change it within the chip you can use "[]" or '.' commands.
        <br>
        An array is a type of object, an empty space that has the potential to infinitely expand on itself, and can contain anything you ever want. <br>This robot and the entire universe could exist within an array; <br>
        lets not get too bogged down on that <br>
        But arrays are not entirely straight forward, seeing as it counts from 0. Say an array has [The universe, the robot, me], <br>
        I want to access me, so I must interact with the array using [2] not [3]
        <br>
        Worry not, typing that out confused me too. I guess that's what happens when you build a processing chip for a robot <br>
