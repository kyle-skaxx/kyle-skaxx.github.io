    <H3>Long term goal or career pathway</H3>
    <P> In the spirit of full candor, my long term goal would have to be to retire at an age a fraction of the average retirement age in Aotearoa. (also, machine learning is dope and would be a niche i would full send in)<br>
        <em><b>I stand by what I said ahahaha. But now after learning about something that one of my facilitators are doing(they've got goals to help marginalized communities through setting up a campus), I found it extremely motivating
            I now realize that the impact I want to make is larger than just retiring early, I want to do something along the lines of what they are doing but I don't know how to get there yet, but I'm sure it'll come with time. Maybe I'll join them who knows(if they'll have me)

    <h3> My strengths and limitations</h3>
    <p>
    I like to view myself as technologically adapted, having grown up around a gaming culture in the Philippines. Vivid memories of rushing to the internet cafes with my classmates to bet our lunch money on DoTA matches come to mind as I write this.
    <br> This trait, along with my cheery disposition, and eagerness to learn everything there is to be learned will be what will get me through all the future challenges I shall face. (and having talked to a couple facilitators there will definitely be some.)
    <br>My limitations will be that I tend to get fixated on new topics or concepts as a whole and I tend to go down the "rabbit hole" more so than I see other people do. This is definitely a challenge I am trying to overcome seeing as there is so much to learn on this course and 
    my time management is not where I want it to be yet. A wise man once told me, <u>progress not perfection.</u> <br>
    <em><b>Yeah nah I stand by these too, but also I found out that when I get frustrated I laugh at the problem (which is probably a coping mechanism
    but hey its a healthy one right?) Yeah we take those around here, Im gonna mark it down and consider it a strength. That being said, I also noticed that when I get UBER-stuck on a problem I just ignore it,
    which is NOT a healthy coping mechanism, something I won't be able to get away with in bootcamp.

    <H3> What non-technical skills I expect to gain from EDA </H3>
    <p>The ability to work with a team in the tech space is something that is very exciting to me, as I have only ever worked in labour and sales jobs.</p><br>
    <em><b>Pair-programming is a skill I want to develop seeing as I know there will be an industry full of people with vast experience. Learning
        how to work with a variety people will help me expand my skill-set even more if I can work and/or learn from as many people as I can.
    </b></em>
    <h3> What non-technical challenges do I see myself having at bootcamp</h3>
    <p><em><b>Having a healthy balance of study and life, maintaining my personal relationships will be a struggle.</b></em></p>
    <h3>How I will manage my workload</h3>
    <p>Open communication with any person I am working with. Thats the key to me really</p>
    <h3>How I will seek help</h3>
    <p>To have a good crack at the problem, if its unsuccessful I will use the resources available to me in Discord; facilitators and fellow students</p>
    <h3>What I expect from the facilitators</h3>
    <p>For them to answer any questions I have, which Jo has shown great patience with. (shoutout to Jo!)</p>
    <h3>What I expect from the bootcamp team</h3>
    <em><b>To be quite frank I do not know what to expect, but at the very least I expect them to hold me to a certain industry standard while pushing me 
        to be the best person I can be!!
    </b></em>
    <h3>What I expect from myself in Bootcampâ„¢</h3>
    <b><em>A lot of people in my life and people I meet in my job always say I'm gonna do big things in life, and when 
        I ask them what they mean they just say 'I don't know I just feel it' or something along those lines. Whether 
        they were talking **** or they meant it, I'm starting to believe them these days ahaha. I just want to apply myself
         to the best I can and I will try my absolute best to utilize all the resources I have whether it be my facilitators or my
        fellow students!(plus implement better timekeeping through Toggl) </em></b>
