    <h1>Neuroplasticity </h1>
    <h2>Inside your brain</h2>
   <h3>Much knowledge, very focus </h3>
    <p class="paragraphs">Described to be the nervous systems' ability to change itself in response to experiences,(usually when it detects a need for adaptation) an 
        understanding of this concept is beneficial to anyone who wants to improve cognitive function or to use it as an alternative way
        of perceiving 'intelligence'; as something that comes from the habits of the individual rather than something that is innate and hereditary.

        theres audio, audiovisual, and visual mediums for the content. (this blog is sponsored by Huberman Labs)

                Neuroplasticity can be engaged in many different ways, but I have found that a big part of invoking it is 
                developing the habits. I have always been aware of the benefits of improving neuroplasticity, but my attempts
                to form a habit were of a lackluster nature to say the very least; to put candidly, I would see improvements
                and pull back the effort thinking the improvements were permanent and not a product of my habits.
                Therefore from this point forward, I shall be making a conscious effort to form a habit out of the 9 points in <i>
                The Super Protocolâ„¢.</i> And hey, maybe you should too!

        <p class="paragraphs">
                In researching about growth mindset something clicked with me, it's got a multitude of parallels with neuroplasticity!
                In my current job we have a tremendous focus on growth mindset as having a fixed mindset can lead to poor performance; quips like
                "don't wish it was easier, wish you were better" were thrown around a lot in the office. Having a growth mindset 
                also meant that we had to put on an opportunity lens, every interaction I had in a day was an opportunity to get 
                better; sale or no sale. This links back to the habit of expecting and embracing errors that boost neuroplasticity,
                where expecting keeps us alert enough maybe notice or prevent previous and new errors.

        <p class="paragraphs">
            As I type this out I now realize that in some aspects of my life I hold a growth mindset, and in others, 
            I fluctuate from having a growth/fixed mindset. I have always noticed that my pattern of going from fixed to growth mindsets
            also coincides with how much I am learning on a day-to-day basis, four weeks into this course and several of my 
            fixed mindsets are slowly shifting as I handle every topic coming from a different perspective. I have a long way to go but
            I am excited to see where I get mentally after I apply all that I have learned from this topic.

        There's a catch though, these methods and concepts can only be truly applied when the intent comes from a genuine desire to be better.
