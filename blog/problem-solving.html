<h1>Problem solving</h1>
   <h2>How's it going?</h2>
   <p class="paragraphs">
    It's going. Two weeks into learning javascript and wow is it a challenge, so many new concepts 
    while building on fundamentals; my mental fortitude got tested. At one point I was so tunnel-visioned
    I was working on an exercise while completely forgetting the brief, I was reverse engineering a challenge
    through the error messages I was getting. It was no surprise I went over the timeboxes after the first two Repls,
    but what surprised me was how less stressed I was in comparison to the first week of learning javascript. What really 
    helped me grasp the concepts I was having difficulty with was Brennan, a fellow student; he was able
    to frame the logic of what I was doing in a way that I understood very easily.(legend)
<br>
    It got me thinking to back in sprint 1 where these methods first got introduced to us, and the difference
    in my confidence in applying them then and now. 
    <br>
    So naturally, I HAD to make a chart. 
    <br>

    <br>
    I rated myself out of 100 for all the problem-solving methods, for both sprints 1 and 4. Over the past few weeks I
    am more confident in my pseudo-code and in reading error messages, although most of it still looks like a bunch of random
    characters; I am starting to speak computer. Since there's no better way to learn a language than conversing with a 
    native speaker, I talked to my computer alot this sprint. A LOT
    <br>
    Ever since working with javascript I have console logged a whole heap more than I did in sprint 1 when it was exclusively
    HTML and CSS, so in a way I guess javascript helped me in the end. Right? I have always been confident in googling and asking 
    for help in discord and both are ways that I have always resorted to, and I am a lot more confident in trying new 
    stuff now.
    <br>
    This week has been a wild ride, and my problem-solving skills have really stepped up to the plate this sprint; my ability
    to identify the problem, execute an elegant fix, and employ multiple techniques simultaneously really
    surprised me. All this can be seen in the screenshot below:
    <img src="img/problem-solving-ss.png">
    But in all seriousness, what you see is not where I want to be, I want that chart to be as full of yellow as it can be. I 
    am excited for what this course has in store for me, and where it will take me; and I'm here for it.
    A wise man once told me progress, not perfection.
